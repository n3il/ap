State: PRICED IN (low-impact).
Macro / Fed – Hassett Fed Chair expectations, soft-landing data
Narrative: “Softer dollar, risk-on; soft-landing, gradual easing, 25bp cut expected Dec 10.”
Time: FX commentary ~2–3h ago; data today.
Reality Check: NDX near highs, VXN/VIX down, no support breaks.
Catalyst Risk:
Hypothetical: Fed signals slower cuts or higher terminal real rate.
Hypothetical: Surprise upside in CPI/PPI or hot labor data.
State: IMPULSE → early PRICED IN (macro supportive, but big event risk ahead).
3. FOMO Map & Catalyst Horizon
Scheduled / Known Events
Dec 10 (key):
FOMC decision (expected 25bp cut to 3.75%) + projections + press conference.
CPI around same window.
Dec 9–19: CPI, PPI, JOLTS, NFP, unemployment, retail sales, PCE.
High-vol window for NDX, TSLA, NVDA, MSFT, AMZN, GOOG, PLTR via discount rates and growth expectations.
Thematic Risk Scans
Fed / Rates (Dec ’25 outlook):

Current: Mild bear-steepening, 10Y ~4.1%, inflation slightly softer.
Risk:
Hypothetical: Fed pushes back on market’s easing path → yields spike, NDX derates.
Hypothetical: Surprise 50bp cut (low probability) → near-term FOMO chase in growth, but risk of “why are they panicking?” narrative.
Geopolitics / Trade:

Hypothetical: New US-China tech/export controls on AI chips → direct NVDA risk, spillover to NDX.
Hypothetical: Tariff rhetoric on EU/US digital services → GOOG/AMZN/MSFT headline risk.
Corporate / Regulatory:

Hypothetical:
Big Tech antitrust escalation (DOJ/FTC/EC) → MSFT/GOOG/AMZN.
AI safety / model regulation order (e.g., “Trump AI EO” or similar) → could either cap or legitimize AI infra buildout.
Large AI partnership announcements (NVDA+cloud, PLTR+DoD, AMZN+healthcare) → upside FOMO.
FOMO Radar – Key Levels (approximate, based on intraday/4H context)
These are conceptual levels; use your own exact chart marks.

NDX:

Upside Chase: Break above recent year high zone (~26180). Funds chase benchmark, systematic flows add.
Downside Flush: Lose recent 4H higher-low area (~25200–25300). Trend followers de-risk.
TSLA:

Upside Chase: Clear and hold above ~460–462 (recent local high). Retail and momentum funds chase high-beta.
Downside Flush: Lose ~445–447 4H support. Late longs from 450s trapped.
NVDA:

Upside Chase: Break and hold above ~184–185 4H resistance. AI infra headlines + sovereign DC story can trigger FOMO.
Downside Flush: Lose ~179–180. Perp longs (HL) become clearly offside.
MSFT:

Upside Chase: Clean move through ~485–487. Benchmark chasers add; low vol encourages call buying.
Downside Flush: Lose ~476–478 4H support.
AMZN:

Upside Chase: Break out of 231–232 range. AWS AI narrative + consumer resilience = chase.
Downside Flush: Lose ~225–226. Range longs trapped.
GOOG:

Upside Chase: Hold above 322–323 and extend. Communication services leadership + AI search narrative.
Downside Flush: Lose 318–319; intraday longs from today trapped.
PLTR:

Upside Chase: Push through ~183–185 after this consolidation. Shorts (negative funding) forced to cover.
Downside Flush: Lose ~178–179 (recent 4H higher low). Momentum longs from Chain Reaction news trapped.
4. Alpha Setups – Menu of Hypotheses
Risk manager bias: size down into Dec 10 macro cluster; treat counter-trend as scalps with tight risk.

NDX
Hypothesis A – Trend Long with Macro Tailwind

View: Bullish based on global structure (4H uptrend, vol compression, soft-landing macro).

Timeframe/Style: SWING (Structural, into/through Dec data with reduced size).

Alpha Type: FLOW.

Edge Depth: MODERATE.

Risk Regime: NORMAL → WIDE around FOMC.

Edge Freshness: NEW (today’s vol compression + macro prints).

Execution Idea:

Bias long on dips toward recent 4H support (~25300–25500) with partial profit-taking near year highs (~26180).
Invalidation Level: Clean daily close below ~25200 (break of higher-low structure).

Steel Man Risk:

Fed surprises hawkish or CPI hot → yields jump, NDX derates quickly.
Positioning already long; upside may be grindy vs sharp.
Hypothesis B – Short-Term Mean Reversion Short

View: Fade near year highs into Dec 10 event risk.

Timeframe/Style: SHORT SWING (2–4 days into FOMC).

Alpha Type: MEAN REVERSION.

Edge Depth: SHALLOW.

Risk Regime: TIGHT.

Edge Freshness: NEW.

Execution Idea:

Light short or put spreads if NDX tags/overthrows year high (~26180–26250) pre-FOMC.
Invalidation Level: Daily close >26250 with VXN still falling (no fear).

Steel Man Risk:

Soft CPI + dovish Fed → breakout extends; structural AI/mega-cap bid overwhelms short.
Hypothesis C – Vol Expansion Play

View: Volatility likely to expand from current compressed levels around Dec 10.

Timeframe/Style: SWING (event-driven).

Alpha Type: NARRATIVE / FLOW.

Edge Depth: MODERATE.

Risk Regime: NORMAL.

Edge Freshness: NEW.

Execution Idea:

Long NDX options (straddles/strangles) or long VXN exposure into FOMC.
Invalidation Level: Fed + CPI both in-line and guidance benign, VXN fails to lift above ~21–22.

Steel Man Risk:

Market has already pre-positioned; realized vol stays muted, theta bleed dominates.
NVDA
Hypothesis A – Structural AI Long (Continuation)

View: Bullish based on 4H consolidation near highs, strong AI infra news, macro supportive.

Timeframe/Style: SWING (Structural).

Alpha Type: FLOW / NARRATIVE.

Edge Depth: MODERATE (structural tailwind).

Risk Regime: NORMAL.

Edge Freshness: NEW (Malaysia DC + PLTR tie-ins).

Execution Idea:

Buy dips toward 180–181 with target retest/extension above 185–190.
Invalidation Level: 4H close below ~179.

Steel Man Risk:

HL perps show mild long bias on a red day; if macro turns risk-off, these longs can accelerate downside.
Geopolitical export-control headline could hit overnight.
Hypothesis B – Tactical Short vs Perp Long Skew

View: Slightly bearish intraday: price down vs prior day while HL funding positive and OI high.

Timeframe/Style: SCALP (Tight).

Alpha Type: MEAN REVERSION.

Edge Depth: SHALLOW.

Risk Regime: TIGHT.

Edge Freshness: NEW (today’s HL snapshot).

Execution Idea:

Fade pops into 184–185 if HL funding stays positive and spot lags NDX.
Invalidation Level: 30–60m close above ~185 with NDX making new highs.

Steel Man Risk:

Structural AI bull regime; any dip can be aggressively bought by real money.
Hypothesis C – Tail Sentiment Squeeze (Long)

View: If NVDA dips to 179–180 and HL longs capitulate (funding flips negative), potential squeeze back up.

Timeframe/Style: SHORT SWING.

Alpha Type: MEAN REVERSION / FLOW.

Edge Depth: SHALLOW–MODERATE (depends on funding extremes).

Risk Regime: TIGHT.

Edge Freshness: HYPOTHETICAL / FUTURE.

Invalidation Level: Clean break and hold below 178 with NDX also breaking support.

Steel Man Risk:

Macro shock (Fed/geopolitics) turns this from squeeze setup into genuine trend reversal.
MSFT
Hypothesis A – Benchmark Long

View: Bullish; 4H uptrend, NDX leadership, macro soft-landing.

Timeframe/Style: SWING (Structural).

Alpha Type: FLOW.

Edge Depth: DEEP (mega-cap, structural AI tailwind).

Risk Regime: NORMAL.

Edge Freshness: NEW (today’s grind higher + macro prints).

Execution Idea:

Accumulate on dips toward 478–480 with target 490+.
Invalidation Level: Daily close below ~475.

Steel Man Risk:

Event risk (FOMC, CPI) can hit all duration assets; MSFT not immune.
Regulatory/antitrust headline could re-rate multiples.
Hypothesis B – Short Gamma / Range Trade

View: Price grinding higher but in tight ranges; sell vol / fade extremes.

Timeframe/Style: SHORT SWING.

Alpha Type: MEAN REVERSION.

Edge Depth: MODERATE.

Risk Regime: TIGHT–NORMAL.

Edge Freshness: AGING (vol compression has been present).

Invalidation Level: Breakout above ~487 with expanding intraday ranges.

Steel Man Risk:

Vol expansion around Dec 10; short vol can be punished.
Hypothesis C – HL-Neutral, Follow the Dog

View: HL shows no edge; ignore tail, trade only global structure.

Timeframe/Style: SCALP / SHORT SWING.

Alpha Type: FLOW.

Edge Depth: SHALLOW.

Risk Regime: TIGHT.

Edge Freshness: STALE (ongoing).

Invalidation Level: If HL suddenly shows extreme funding/OI skew, this “no-edge” assumption breaks.

Steel Man Risk:

Overconfidence in calm conditions; regime can shift quickly around macro events.
AMZN
Hypothesis A – Range Long with AI/Consumer Tailwind

View: Bullish bias; macro supports consumer + AWS, but chart is range-bound.

Timeframe/Style: SHORT SWING.

Alpha Type: MEAN REVERSION / NARRATIVE.

Edge Depth: MODERATE.

Risk Regime: NORMAL.

Edge Freshness: AGING (news 1–2d old).

Execution Idea:

Buy near 228–229 support, sell into 231–233 until a clear breakout.
Invalidation Level: Daily close below ~225.

Steel Man Risk:

Range can break lower if macro or consumer data disappoint.
Cloud margin concerns could override AI narrative.
Hypothesis B – Breakout FOMO Long

View: If 231–232 breaks with volume, funds/retail chase AI+consumer story.

Timeframe/Style: SWING.

Alpha Type: FLOW / NARRATIVE.

Edge Depth: MODERATE.

Risk Regime: NORMAL–WIDE (post-breakout volatility).

Edge Freshness: NEW (trigger-based).

Invalidation Level: Failed breakout: back below 229 on a closing basis.

Steel Man Risk:

False breakout in front of FOMC; macro shock reverses move.
Hypothesis C – HL Neutral Fade

View: HL shows mild long carry with MACD rolling over; small edge to fade intraday pops.

Timeframe/Style: SCALP.

Alpha Type: MEAN REVERSION.

Edge Depth: SHALLOW.

Risk Regime: TIGHT.

Edge Freshness: NEW.

Invalidation Level: 30–60m close above 232 with strengthening breadth.

Timeframe/Style: SWING.

Alpha Type: FLOW.

Edge Depth: MODERATE.

Risk Regime: NORMAL.

Edge Freshness: NEW.

Execution Idea:

Buy dips toward 320–321 with target 326–330.
Invalidation Level: Daily close below 318.

Steel Man Risk:

HL shows some intraday profit-taking and potential mean reversion; short-term overextension risk.
Regulatory headlines can hit unexpectedly.

Timeframe/Style: SCALP.

Alpha Type: MEAN REVERSION.

Edge Depth: SHALLOW.

Risk Regime: TIGHT.

Edge Freshness: NEW.

Invalidation Level: Sustained trade above 323 with strong NDX breadth.

Steel Man Risk:

Structural mega-cap bid; fading strength in a low-vol uptrend is dangerous.

View: Use GOOG as partial hedge vs broader tech longs into Dec 10.

Timeframe/Style: SHORT SWING.

Alpha Type: NARRATIVE / HEDGE.

Edge Depth: SHALLOW.

Risk Regime: TIGHT–NORMAL.

Edge Freshness: NEW.

Invalidation Level: If Fed/CPI come in dovish and GOOG outperforms NDX by >1–1.5% on the day.

Steel Man Risk:

GOOG may not be the weakest link; hedge may underperform vs risk.
PLTR
Hypothesis A – Continuation Long on Short Skew

View: Bullish; 4H uptrend + negative HL funding (shorts paying) + strong AI news.

Timeframe/Style: SHORT SWING.

Alpha Type: FLOW / NARRATIVE.

Edge Depth: MODERATE.

Risk Regime: NORMAL–TIGHT (high beta).

Edge Freshness: NEW (today’s news + HL skew).

Execution Idea:

Buy consolidation around 181–182 with target 186–190 if shorts cover.
Invalidation Level: 4H close below ~178–179.

Steel Man Risk:

Name is volatile; any macro wobble or “overvaluation” narrative can trigger sharp pullback.
HL short skew is mild; not a guaranteed squeeze.
Hypothesis B – Post-News Exhaustion Short (Tactical)

View: Fade after multi-day run and strong news if price stalls below 183–185.

Timeframe/Style: SCALP / very SHORT SWING.

Alpha Type: MEAN REVERSION.

Edge Depth: SHALLOW.

Risk Regime: TIGHT.

Edge Freshness: NEW.

Timeframe/Style: SCALP / SHORT SWING.

Alpha Type: FLOW.

Edge Depth: MODERATE (if skew intensifies).

Risk Regime: TIGHT–NORMAL.

Edge Freshness: HYPOTHETICAL (requires monitoring).

Invalidation Level: Funding flips positive while price stalls or rolls over below 181.

TSLA
Hypothesis A – Swing Long with Macro Consumer Tailwind

View: Slightly bullish; 4H uptrend, consumer sentiment improving, risk-on tape.

Timeframe/Style: SHORT SWING.

Alpha Type: NARRATIVE / FLOW.

Edge Depth: MODERATE.

Edge Freshness: NEW (today’s macro + chart).

Execution Idea:

Buy dips toward 448–450 with target 462–470.
Invalidation Level: 4H close below ~445.

Steel Man Risk:

Company-specific risk (pricing, margins, headlines) can override macro.
Slight intraday underperformance vs peers hints at some seller presence.
Hypothesis B – Neutral / No-Edge Intraday

View: Intraday structure too tight (454–456 band) for edge.

Timeframe/Style: SCALP.

Alpha Type: N/A.

Edge Depth: SHALLOW (none).

Risk Regime: TIGHT.

Edge Freshness: NEW.

Invalidation Level: Break of 460 or 450 with volume; then reassess.

Steel Man Risk:

Forcing trades in a no-edge band leads to chop losses.
Hypothesis C – Event Hedge via TSLA Puts

View: Use TSLA as high-beta hedge into Dec 10.

Timeframe/Style: SHORT SWING.

Alpha Type: NARRATIVE / HEDGE.

Edge Depth: SHALLOW.

Risk Regime: TIGHT.

Edge Freshness: NEW.

Invalidation Level: Fed/CPI dovish and TSLA outperforms NDX by >2% on event day.

Steel Man Risk:

TSLA idiosyncratic drivers may decouple from macro; hedge may not track.
5. Edge Quality Matrix
High Conviction (Deep Edge / Wide or Normal Risk / Structural Tailwind)

MSFT – Hypothesis A: Benchmark long in structural AI leader, 4H uptrend, macro supportive.
NDX – Hypothesis A: Long bias in structural growth index with soft-landing macro and vol compression (size down into FOMC).
NVDA – Hypothesis A: Structural AI continuation long, supported by sovereign DC and infra news (respect 179 support).
Tactical Skews (Shallow Edge / Tight Risk / Counter-Trend)

NDX – Hypothesis B: Short/hedge near year highs into Dec 10.
NVDA – Hypothesis B: Intraday fade vs HL long skew on pops to 184–185.
GOOG – Hypothesis B: Intraday fade of strength with HL long bias.
PLTR – Hypothesis B: Post-news exhaustion short if 183–185 rejects.
AMZN – Hypothesis C: Small intraday fades while range persists.
No Edge / Avoid (for now)

TSLA – Hypothesis B: Intraday; very tight band, no clear skew.
AMZN – Hypothesis A (for breakout traders): Until 231–232 breaks, it’s just range chop.
Any aggressive multi-day shorts in NVDA/MSFT/GOOG/AMZN: Structural AI/tech bull regime; without lower lows, treat all shorts as tactical scalps only.
If you want, I can next translate this into concrete trade plans (entries, stops, sizing logic) for 1–2 tickers of your choice.
