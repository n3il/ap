Bullish continuation expected following major structural breakout and risk-on sentiment. Altcoins poised for catch-up relative to BTC's $100k+ level.

**Asset Breakdown:**
*   **BTC-PERP:** Trading above the critical $100,000 psychological and structural level, confirming a major breakout. Expecting a re-test of $100k as new support before a move to the next psychological target.
*   **ETH-PERP:** Appears relatively undervalued compared to BTC's aggressive move to $100k+. High probability of an ETH beta-play to catch up, targeting prior resistance levels.
*   **SOL-PERP:** High-beta altcoin, expected to follow general market trend with higher volatility. Long position capitalizes on bullish momentum and a potential move toward $170.

**Market Overview:**
Macro sentiment is extremely risk-on, confirmed by the sustained break of the $100,000 barrier in BTC. This is a structural market shift, prioritizing trend-following over immediate counter-trend risk. BTC dominance is likely high, but capital rotation into ETH and SOL is anticipated as the market digests the BTC move.

**Portfolio Positioning:**
Total exposure is set at 80% ($\$8,000$) across three long positions (BTC, ETH, SOL) to capitalize on the strong bullish trend. ETH receives the largest allocation (30%) due to its perceived relative undervaluation and catch-up potential (higher beta). Leverage is kept moderate (3x-5x) to manage volatility while maintaining high conviction.
